# google-play-eero-update-
I recently updated my server to the latest version (10.10.15) and have had several issues with the Android client (v2.6.2 on the Google Play store). The phone is running Android 15. The server is running on a Ubuntu machine (cannot access it at the time of writing to check exact version) which accesses the main storage running on a NAS. I use Tailscale to access the media server on both Windows 10 and Android

All movies and TVs are stored in MKV and music files are stored as FLACs.

I can provide logs when I get back to my PC. Let me know the best approach to retrieve the logs and whether you want both server and Android logs. The images provided are screenshots of my phone screen.

Unable to Play Files
First, I am unable to play any file, I press the play button on the file and it sometimes shows the spinner indicating activity but just stays there and doesn't progress. In some cases the spinner doesn't appear at all. In the second instance, I am unable to switch to another view (e.g. entering a collection or starting another file). This occurs on both the admin account and non-admin account.
